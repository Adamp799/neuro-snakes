# README 

gym, pytorch, and NEAT-Python libraries must be installed.

Functions can be run from the jupyter notebook files or from the terminal.
test_book.ipynb provides manual test and random test functions for the customisable Snake environment.

train_book.ipynb contains functions to run the training algorithm, to load the best results from training, and 
to apply a render test to view the best network's performance graphically. Data visualisation functions are called
automatically after the training algorithm is run.
